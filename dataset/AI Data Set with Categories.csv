MRI (whole spine)

Report: 
MRI of the whole spine was performed. No prior study is available for comparison. Motion artefacts degrade the quality of the images. 

There is straightening of the normal cervical and lumbar lordosis. Block C6-7 vertebrae noted. The vertebral alignment and heights are otherwise preserved. The bone marrow returns normal signal intensity. The conus medullaris end at L1. 

The cervical and lumbar discs are desiccated with narrowing of the C3-4 to C5-6, and L2-3 intervertebral disc spaces. Small posterior central annular fissures are seen at L2-3 to L4-5 intervertebral discs. 

There are multilevel cervical disc osteophyte complexes from C3-4 to C5-6 and thickened ligamentum flavum, causing indentation of the spinal cord at these levels, worst at C5-6. The spinal cord signal is preserved. Multilevel uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy causes moderate left C2-3, severe left C3-4, severe right and moderate left C4-5 and C5-6, and moderate bilateral C7-T1 neural foraminal stenosis. 

The thoracic spinal canal and neural foramina are largely patent. 

There are disc protrusions from L2-3 to L5-S1 along with ligamentum flavum and facet joint hypertrophy, leading to mild to moderate spinal canal stenosis at these levels, worst at L3-4 level. There are also mild bilateral L2-3, moderate bilateral L3-4, mild bilateral L4-5 and moderate left L5-S1 lateral recesses narrowing. Mild to moderate bilateral L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 and left L5-S1 neural foraminal stenosis is noted. The left L5 descending nerve root is in contact with the disc bulge and adjacent facet hypertrophy. 

The visualised brain is unremarkable. No paravertebral lesion is seen. ",Does physical labour at work,15 years,"

MRI (lumbar spine)
Report:
There  is  normal  alignment  of  the  lumbar  spine.  The  signal  from  the  marrow,  cortical  outlines  and  endplates  of  the  vertebral  bodies  is  normal.    
The  interverbral  discs  between  L3/4  and  L5/S1  levels  are  desiccated.  
At  L3/4,  the  central  canal  is  mildly  narrowed  by  hypertrophy  of  the  ligamentum  flavum  and  facet  joints.  
At  L4/5,  there  is  mild  loss  of  disc  height.  A  central  and  right  paracentral  disc  protrusion  is  seen.  This  causes  mild  narrowing  of  the  central  canal,  with  near  obliteration  of  the  right  lateral  recess.  Mild  narrowing  of  the  exit  foramina  is  noted,  worse  on  the  right.    
At  L5/S1,  there  is  loss  of  disc  height.  A  central  and  left  paracentral  disc  protrusion  is  seen.  Severe  narrowing  of  the  left  lateral  recess  is  noted.  This  appears  unchanged  from  the  previous  study.  Narrowing  of  the  exit  foramina  is  noted,  worse  on  the  left.  There  is  likely  impingement  of  the  descending  S1  nerve  root.  
The  conus  medullaris  and  cauda  equina  are  normal  in  appearance.  The  spinal  cord  ends  at  L1  level.      
No  abnormal  contrast  enhancement  is  detected.  ",Does housechores,1 year,Pain worsens upon prolonged walking/sitting/standing (max 10 min),Severe impact,"(1) Limited a lot

MRI (lumbar spine)
Report: agittal T1W, T2W and IR images of the lumbar spine, and axial T2W images of selected discs were obtained. 

The last unfused vertebra is designated L5, counting from the cranio-cervical junction. 

Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 over L5 is seen. Bilateral L4 pars defects are seen. 

A STIR-hyperintense focus with peripheral fatty rim is seen in the L2 verterbral body. L4-L5 endplate edema is likely related to Modic type I change. The signal from the marrow, cortical outlines and endplates of the vertebral bodies are otherwise unremarkable. 

The intervertebral disks of the lumbar spine are diffusely desiccated. The L4-L5 intervertebral disk is severely reduced in height.

The conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal in appearance. The spinal cord ends at the L1 level. 

At L2-L3, bilateral facet joint arthropathy is seen with no significant spinal canal or exit foraminal stenosis.
At L3-L4, bilateral facet joint arthropathy is seen with no significant spinal canal or exit foraminal stenosis.
At L4-L5, a combination of spondylolisthesis, facet joint arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy results in severe bilateral exit foraminal stenosis impinging on bilateral exiting L4 nerve roots. There is mild spinal canal or lateral recess stenosis is seen.
At L5-S1 mild posterior disc bulge indents thecal sac and causes mild bilateral exit foraminal stenosis.",Does gardening at a senior activity centre,1 year,Pain worsens upon prolonged walking (max 100 metres) and standing (max 5min),No impact,"(1) Limited a lot

MRI (lumbar spine)

Report: Non contrast MRI lumbar spine performed: sagittal T2W, T1W, STIR, axial T2W sequences obtained. Comparison made with lumbar spine radiographs dated 18 March 2017.

There is normal lumbar lordosis. There is normal vertebral alignment. There is complete loss of the L5 vertebral body height, in keeping with a compression fracture and vertebra plana. Remainder of the vertebral body heights are preserved. No concerning marrow signal abnormality seen.

There is mild retropulsion of the compressed L5 vertebra, which, along with facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and prominent epidural fat, causes moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis. There is redundancy of the cauda equina nerve roots cranial to this. There is suspected compression of the descending L5 nerve roots, left greater than right.

The conus lies at the L1 level. The distal cord and conus demonstrates normal signal and size.

There is diffuse disc dessication without loss of intervertebral disc heights. There is mild to moderate facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy within the remainder of the lumbar levels without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.

COMMENTS:
Chronic L5 compression fracture with vertebra plana. There is mild retropulsion of the L5 vertebra resulting in moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis, redundancy of the cauda equina and suspected compression of descending L5 nerve roots.
